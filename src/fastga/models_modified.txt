LIST OF THE MODELS MODIFIED IN THIS BRANCH W.R.T TO THE MAIN BRANCH

Under each section the eventual quantities that have to be added to the initial xml files are written.
These quantities should be quite easy to find for each aircraft.
For the fuselage structural analysis the material properties are implemented as settings.
I already added them for the beechcraft 76, the cirrus sr22 and the TBM930.

Unitary tests can be found in the dedicated files.

MAXIMUM FUEL WEIGHT COMPUTATION
compute_mfw outside of wing components since it uses the LG and nacelle geometry to reduce the fuel distribution
update_wing_area : modified to take in account the new way to compute mfw. fsolve is used
"data:geometry:propulsion:y_ratio_tank_beginning", "data:geometry:propulsion:y_ratio_tank_end"
"data:geometry:propulsion:LE_chord_percentage", "data:geometry:propulsion:TE_chord_percentage"
"settings:geometry:fuel_tanks:depth"

MODIFY CONFIG
module for analysis mode
autonomous

PAYLOAD RANGE
currently in the performance module (not executed during MDA)
autonomous
uses a blank xml file for the use of generate_block_analysis

LANDING GEARS GEOMETRY
removed computation of landing gears geometry in nacelle component and added the lg component

WING LOAD ANALYSIS
compute_relief_force fuel distribution takes in input the beginning and the end of the fuel tanks along the span
it also takes in input the lg y position instead of manually calculating it
as a consequence the classes that call compute_relief_force have seen their inputs updated

DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM
the parameter x_cg has been put again in the function found_cl_repartition (allows to compute the equilibrated polar)

DRAG POLARS
autonomous
in aerodynamics components
not executed during MDA

TURBOPROP MODEL
autonomous
same code structure as IC engine (same inputs / outputs / classes)
folder in fuel_propulsion

FUSELAGE AIRFRAME MASS
added as ComputeFuselageWeightAlternate in the same file as the original model (a1_fuselage_weight)
same output mass name as ComputeFuselageWeight so the new airframe mass is used in the mass breakdown instead of the old one
"data:geometry:cabin:max_differential_pressure", "settings:geometry:fuselage:min_skin_thickness"

FUSELAGE STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS
the bending moment distribution requires the new fuselage airframe mass model to work
autonomous
folder in load analysis module
"settings:materials:fuselage:skin:density"
"settings:materials:fuselage:skin:young_modulus"
"settings:materials:fuselage:skin:sigma_02"
"settings:materials:fuselage:skin:sigma_max"
"settings:materials:fuselage:stringer:density"
"settings:materials:fuselage:stringer:young_modulus"

FRONT AND REAR FREIGHTS
mass of payload updated
cg of payload updated
loadcase : ground and flight load cases updated to take in account the freight variation
cg_variation updated to take in account front and rear freights
"data:geometry:cabin:luggage:mass_max_front", "data:geometry:cabin:luggage:mass_max_rear", "data:geometry:cabin:luggage:front_compartment_first"

FURNISHING MASS BREAKDOWN
in mass_breakdown the eventual extra furnishing weight is taken in account in the furnishing system
"settings:weight:aircraft:extra_furniture_mass"

UTILS.POSTPROCESSING
- new functions in analysis_and_plots
- analysis_and_plots_tbm : file containing the definition of the function generating the comparison table and the polar for tbm convergence analysis in the related notebook
The reference data of the TBM930 is stored in the xml file named TBM-930_reference.
