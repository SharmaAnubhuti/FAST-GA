    "This notebook is dedicated to generate the converged aircraft xml files that will serve for the purpose of the analysis mode as reference aircraft files. A conventional MDA is performed. The yml configuration file is stored in the data folder and is used for each analysis. A rtol of 1e-5 gives a sufficient accuracy so that no visible changes occur when the aircraft passes again through the modules of the code in the analysis mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the widget allows to avoid the user to manually change the name of the aircraft computed and of the output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as for any MDA the engine id and the class parameters have to be manually defined by the user in the yml configuration file. It is advised to change the class parameters with caution as some postprocessing modules require some of the quantities computed with these parameters on (for example the wing structural analysis requires the computation of the slipstream in the aerodynamic module).\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell called \"running complementary methods\" is run after the convergence of the MDA. It consists in classes that are useful for postprocessing reasons but that don't need to be executed at each iteration. They are processed outside of the loop to avoid extra computational time.\n",
