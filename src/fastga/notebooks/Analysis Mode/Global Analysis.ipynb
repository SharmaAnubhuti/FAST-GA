    "# Global Analysis Mode of FAST-OAD-GA\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to couple the different use cases of the analysis mode of FAST-OAD-GA. A reference aircraft is chosen. At first the cabin length of this aircraft is increased, and then the wing span and longitudinal position are modified. The aim is to counterbalance the negative effects of the fuselage length increase with the modifications of the wings. Some quantities called \"certification quantities\" are defined below. The notebook proposes to observe the effect of the fuselage and of the wing modifications on these quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "List of the certification quantities that are used for the comparison between the aircrafts:\n",
    "- Load Analysis of the wings (force, shear force and root bending moment distributions on the wing)\n",
    "- Flight Envelope\n",
    "- Static Margins (stick fixed and stick free)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference aircraft is preferably the output of a MultiDisciplinary Analysis. Please note that if the relative tolerance of the MDA is quite rough (rtol >= 1e3) then it is probable that the aircraft will undergo visible geometrical modifications when passed through the Geometry module. These modifications have nothing to do with the present analysis and to avoid them it is preferable to perform a MDA with a higher accuracy (rtol < 1e4). In that way the only visible modifications will be the one intended by the use case used and the rest of the aircraft geometry will remain untouched. The use of the dedicated notebook \"MDA (adapted for analysis mode)\" will prevent the user from encountering these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of this notebooks is described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initialization of the work environment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The user chooses the aircraft and the engine model he wants to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Definition of the fuselage modifications based on the reference architecture.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The user specifies the cabin length increase he wants to apply, and can also choose the other parameters of the fuselage extension use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Computation of the modified architecture.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the single use cases, the xml file of the modified architecture passes through all FAST-OAD-GA modules with generate_block_analysis. At the end of this section, the reference architecture file is saved under the name \"OUTPUT_REF_FILE\" while the extended fuselage architecture file is saved under the name \"OUTPUT_MOD_FILE\". These two files will form the base of the analysis of the wing span and wing position modifications. Since these files are saved in the output folder, the user can freely skip this part if is has already been performed and directly use the output files in the next sections. In that case the first section which initializes the files still has to be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Analysis of the wing span increase.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section the wing span of the modified architecture is changed. The aim is to study the effect of a wing span increase on the certification quantities. The user defines the different span changes he wants to make like in the wing span increase use case, and then the code returns the related computed aircrafts. A postprocessing cell compares the reference aircraft (OUTPUT_REF_FILE), the extended fuselage aircraft (OUTPUT_MOD_FILE) and the aircrafts with the wing span increased (an aircraft with +20% of wing span would be called output_span_1_2.xml).\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Analysis of the wing longitudinal position modification.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section the wing longitudinal position of the modified architecture is changed. The aim is to study the effect of the wing longitudinal position modification on the certification quantities. The user defines the different wing position changes he wants to make and the code returns the related computed aircrafts. A postprocessing cell compares the reference aircraft (OUTPUT_REF_FILE), the extended fuselage aircraft (OUTPUT_MOD_FILE) and the aircrafts with the wing position modified (an aircraft with a wing moved back by 0.5 meters would be called output_wing_pos_delta_0_5.xml).\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Using fsolve to find the optimal wing position for the static margins**\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonlinear solver fsolve is used in conjunction with the FAST-OAD-GA modules to determine the wing position for the modified architecture that results in a fixed static margin equal to the one of the reference aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the tutorials, the structure of the notebook is based on data transfers between different folders :\n",
    "- The data folder stocks the MDA outputs of the reference aircrafts. These files serve as reference files for the comparison.\n",
    "- The workdir folder stocks the .xml files of the modified architectures passing through the modules of FAST-OAD-GA.\n",
    "- The output folder stocks the final .xml files, which are ready for post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the files of the different sections are saved in the output folder. They are ready to be used in the postprocessing notebook, if the user wants to have access to more visualization tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a proper notebook execution, the use of the analysis_mode branch of FAST-GA-OAD is strongly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user wants to perform a new analysis after the notebook cells have already been run, for any change in the widget values, in the configuration files or in the aircraft modification parameters it is advised to restart the kernel to avoid unwelcomed inconsistencies."

    "## 6. Using fsolve to find the optimal wing position for the static margins\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section we want to find the optimal wing position for which the extended fuselage aircraft has the same fixed static margin as the reference aircraft. The next cell dislays the value of the static margins of the refernce and of the fuselage extended aircrafts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining the function static_margins. This simple function computes a wing position shift by a delta_wing parameter which is its only input. The function then reads the static margin of the computed aircraft and compares it to the reference aircraft one. fsolve is used on this function as the objective is to minimize the difference between the reference static margin and the computed one. The xtol parameter of fsolve has been studied and the algorithm converges to a consistent value for xtol = 0.01. This results in 7 iterations (each iteration roughly requiring 3 minutes of computational time).\n",
    "\n",
    "The 4 first fsolve iterations give results that seem identical and the code does not change the wing position. This is most likely the fsolve algorithm reacting to the fact that when the xml file goes through the FAST-OAD-GA modules all the quantities are updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell displays the found value of delta_wing when the algorithm has converged. The user can then manually generate the corresponding aircraft by putting the delta_wing value in input of the 5th section of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the reference and modified output files are created this section can be independently run."
